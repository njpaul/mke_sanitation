# Milwaukee Sanitation
An Alexa skill for getting your garbage or recycling date.

*This skill __is not__ affiliated in any way with the city of Milwaukee Department of Public Works.*

## How do I get it?
You can download the skill from the Alexa app skills page.

You may also setup a copy of this skill and use/modify it as a developer.
Because of the permissive MIT license of this skill, you may do pretty much anything with it.

## How do I use it?
Simply say *"Alexa, ask Milwaukee Sanitation when is garbage day"*

Ask for help by saying *"Alexa, open Milwaukee Sanitation"*, followed by *"Help"*

## Why was this created?
Quite often in Milwaukee you will see your neighbors set out collection carts a day before or after the real collection date.
This makes you question when the actual date is.
In 2019 Milwaukee stopped distributing paper copies of the collection dates, so you are forced to look it up online or subscribe to updates via text or email.

This skill lets you get the collection date without having to pull it up in a browser, and without having to subscribe to anything.
